# War Card Game
This was my final project for my SCS 141, Programming 2: Mobile App Development, course at Seton Hill University with Professor Brad Messner. 

This project is very flawed, and has a great deal of bugs that have not been nor are planned to be debugged, due to this being my first true dive into mobile development.
